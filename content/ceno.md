Get your compute lined up
-------------------------

Oracle needs people to see it's [new cloud offering](https://cloud.oracle.com/). The 100 billion dollar corporation is offering a nice free tier if you plug in a debt/credit card. We're going to use this offering to run nodes on a network you may not be familiar with.

If you don't like doing this, that's fine it's even easier to run Ceno*(Technically a [ouinet](https://ouinet.work/) node in the ceno flavor) on already existing servers. Just skip ahead to the docker steps and follow along.


Ce.no
-----
[Censorship.No! -- Ceno](https://censorship.no/en/index.html) is a mixnet designed to route news and internet pages into areas with reduced connectivity. It had some prior adoption into the Ukraine-Russia war and from my measures, seems to be hardy. I won't disclose numbers today but I've seen 7 digits of requests passed on my nodes. There is a demand.
